== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How many google ads can it take? =

Up to 3 various adsense ads can be used but you can put the code to refer to the ads as many times as you like in your pages.

= My ads look wrong. Whats up with them? =

You have to make sure you get the right ad format from your Google Adsense code for the area where your ads are being displayed. For example, if you are putting an ad in a sidebar widget, you're probably best with a tall skyscraper advert rather than a 600 pixel wide image ad. Try a few out to see what looks best. Don't forget to take into account the colour or the shape of the corners of the advert to keep it in theme with your page style.
